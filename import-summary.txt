ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk
* CleanSpec.mk
* MODULE_LICENSE_APACHE2
* NOTICE
* proguard.flags
* script\
* script\test.sh
* src-bind\
* src-bind\com\
* src-bind\com\android\
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\FeatureHighlightHelper.java
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\FeedbackHelper.java
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\HelpUtils.java
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\ObjectFactory.java
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\analytics\
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\analytics\AnalyticsUtil.java
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\experiments\
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\experiments\Flags.java
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\util\
* src-bind\com\android\contactsbind\util\UserAgentGenerator.java
* tests\
* tests\Android.mk
* tests\assets\
* tests\assets\README.txt
* tests\assets\quick_test_recording.mp3
* tests\assets\v21_simple.vcf
* tests\assets\v30_simple.vcf

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => com.android.contacts\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => com.android.contacts\src\main\assets\
* res\ => com.android.contacts\src\main\res\
* src\ => com.android.contacts\src\main\java\
* tests\res\ => com.android.contacts\src\androidTest\res\
* tests\src\ => com.android.contacts\src\androidTest\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
